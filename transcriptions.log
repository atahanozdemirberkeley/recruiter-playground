[4] AGENT:
Hey, welcome to our interview. Are you ready to start?

CODE :
def test(s):

    for i in range(s):

        return i

[55] AGENT:
Currently, the code defines a function `test(s)` that loops for `s` iterations and returns `i` immediately after the first loop iteration. This function doesn't implement the Two Sum problem logic yet. Can you explain your overall strategy for solving the Two Sum problem? I'm interested in understanding how you plan to use the data structures or algorithms to solve this.

CODE :
def test(s):

    for i in range(s):

        return i
