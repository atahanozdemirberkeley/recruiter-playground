description: |
  Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers in nums such that they add up to target.
  You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
hints:
  - "Use a hash map to store the difference between the target and each element"
  - "Check if the current element exists in the hash map"
  - "Consider edge cases such as duplicate elements and negative numbers"
