CODE:

def two_sum(nums, target):
    num_map = {}  # Dictionary to store number and its index
    for index, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in num_map:
            return [num_map[complement], index]  # Found the two indices
        num_map[num] = index  # Add the number and its index to the dictionary
    return []  # In case there is no solution


EXPLANATION:

This problem can be efficiently solved using a hash map (or dictionary in Python) to store and map the complement of each element (i.e., target - nums[i]) to its index. By checking if each element's complement exists in the dictionary as we iterate through the array, we can quickly find the pair of indices that sum up to the target.
